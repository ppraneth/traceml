TraceML provides step-level training visibility for PyTorch workloads. It shows where time and memory go inside each training step so you can
quickly understand performance behavior across single-GPU and  single-node DDP runs.

**Current support**
- ✅ Single GPU
- ✅ Single-node multi-GPU (**DDP**)
- ❌ Multi-node DDP (not yet)
- ❌ FSDP / TP / PP (not yet)

---

## What You See in Minutes

-   System signals (CPU, RAM, GPU)
-   Breakdown of each training step:
    -   `dataloader → forward → backward → optimizer → overhead`
-   Median vs worst rank (in case of DDP)
-   Skew (%) to surface imbalance
-   GPU memory (allocated + peak)


Healthy runs are clearly stable. Unstable runs reveal drift, imbalance, or memory creep early.

---
## Quick Start

Install:

``` bash
pip install traceml-ai
```

Wrap your training step:

``` python
from traceml.decorators import trace_step

for batch in dataloader:
    with trace_step(model):
        outputs = model(batch["x"])
        loss = criterion(outputs, batch["y"])
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()
        optimizer.zero_grad(set_to_none=True)
```

Run with cli:

``` bash
traceml run train.py
```

The terminal dashboard opens alongside your logs.

Optional web UI:

``` bash
traceml run train.py --mode=dashboard
```

## What TraceML Surfaces

### Step-Level Signals

-   Dataloader fetch time
-   Step time (low-overhead, GPU-aware)
-   Step GPU memory (allocated + peak)

Across ranks:

-   Median (typical behavior)
-   Worst rank (slowest / highest memory)
-   Skew (% difference)

This makes rank imbalance and straggler behavior immediately visible.

---

## Deep-Dive Mode (Optional)

Enable model-level hooks for diagnostic context:

``` python
from traceml.decorators import trace_model_instance
trace_model_instance(model)
```

Use together with `trace_step(model)` to enable:

-   Per-layer memory signals
-   Per-layer forward/backward timing
-   Lightweight failure attribution (experimental)

If not enabled, ESSENTIAL signals remain unchanged.

---

## What It Is Not

-   Not a replacement for PyTorch Profiler or Nsight
-   Not an auto-tuner
-   Not a kernel-level tracer

TraceML focuses on step-level visibility that is practical during real
training runs.

---

## Supported Environments

-   Python 3.9--3.13
-   PyTorch 1.12+
-   macOS (Intel/ARM), Linux
-   Single GPU
-   Single-node DDP

**Known limitations**: With gradient accumulation enabled,
step-level metrics may be unreliable (micro-step vs optimizer-step). Fix in progress.

## Hugging Face Integration

TraceML provides a seamless integration with Hugging Face `transformers` via `TraceMLTrainer`.

### Usage

Replace `transformers.Trainer` with `traceml.hf_decorators.TraceMLTrainer`.

```python
from traceml.hf_decorators import TraceMLTrainer

trainer = TraceMLTrainer(
    model=model,
    args=training_args,
    train_dataset=train_ds,
    eval_dataset=eval_ds,
    traceml_enabled=True,
)
```

---

## PyTorch Lightning Integration

TraceML offers official support for PyTorch Lightning models through `TraceMLCallback`.

### Usage

Simply pass the callback to your `Trainer`.

```python
import lightning as L
from traceml.utils.lightning import TraceMLCallback
from traceml.decorators import trace_model_instance

class MyLightningModule(L.LightningModule):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.model = ...
        # Optional: enable deep-dive per-layer instrumentation
        trace_model_instance(self)

    def training_step(self, batch, batch_idx):
        ...

trainer = L.Trainer(callbacks=[TraceMLCallback()])
```

---

## Roadmap

Near-term: - Single-node DDP hardening - Disk run logging -
Compatibility validation (gradient accumulation, torch.compile) -
Accelerate / Lightning wrappers

Next: - Multi-node DDP - Initial FSDP support

Later: - Tensor / Pipeline parallel awareness
